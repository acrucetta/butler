# Design Docs

## Current Design Docs
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (active): system topology and runtime interfaces.
- `docs/MCP.md` (active): MCP CLI generation contracts, scope, and operator commands.
- `docs/exec-plans/completed/2026-02-13-agent-harness-bootstrap.md` (completed): harness bootstrap design and decisions.

## Authoring Rules
- Keep design docs specific to architecture or major implementation choices.
- Link each design doc to at least one plan and one verification command.
- Prefer small updates over large rewrites to keep history legible.
